# Git Pull Request Practice

This repository was created to practice creating and merging Git pull requests.

## Tasks Completed

1. Created 5 Pull Requests
   - I created 5 separate pull requests in this repository.

2. Merged all 5 Pull Requests using Merge Commit
   - I merged all 5 pull requests into the main branch using the "Create a merge commit" strategy on GitHub.

## Lessons Learned

Through this practice, I learned the following:

1. Creating Pull Requests: I gained experience in creating new branches, making changes, and submitting pull requests on GitHub.

2. Merging Strategies: I learned about the Merge Commit strategy for merging pull requests and practiced using it to integrate all 5 pull requests into the main branch.

3. Collaboration Workflow: This exercise simulated a basic collaborative workflow, where I had to manage multiple pull requests and ensure they were properly merged into the main branch.

4. Git Command Line: I utilized Git Bash to perform various Git commands, such as switching between branches, merging, and pushing changes to the remote repository.

Overall, this practice has helped me improve my understanding of the Git pull request process and work towards becoming a more proficient Git user.
